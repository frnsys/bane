Bane
====================

This is basically a more lightweight version of Backbone Boilerplate.
My primary use case is rapid prototyping, where the production and
testing tools provided by Backbone Boilerplate aren't really
necessary. However, I still want robust and modular code, so that if
these prototypes *do* need to be adapted for production, it's a smooth
process.

## Changes ##
* [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) added as the templating engine
* [Underscore.string](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string) added
	to provide some extra string manipulation features
* Testing frameworks removed
* Almond removed
* Build system (grunt) removed
* Added some example code


## Getting started ##

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ftzeng/bane.git && cd bane && ./powerup.sh
```

See the [guide](https://github.com/ftzeng/bane/blob/master/guide.md) for more information.
